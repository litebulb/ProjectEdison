## 1.0 Introduction

This document demonstrates how to perform administration activities for the Project Edison solution. In addition to the user document, this document explains the process for verifying data in the resources, updating SKUs, enabling security steps for the resources and performing DR activities for Standard and Premium solutions.

**Note**: This document is subjected to an assumption, that the solution is already deployed through ARM template, using the **Deployment Guide**.

## 2.0 Accessing the Edison Admin Portal Application
Refer to the **User Guide Document** for instructions on accessing the Edison admin portal application and the User Guide Document to onboard devices, generate activated responses, configuring responses primary and secondary range, download the history of the responses in a selected time span and receiving emergency messages, from Project Edison Solution.
The Project Edison Solution is enabling rapid response to nearby community events that might increase the danger level of persons in the nearby vicinity.

## 3.0 Security

### 3.1 Storage Security

#### 3.1.1 Secure Transfer Required

The **Secure transfer required** option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the account from secure connections. For example, when you're calling REST APIs to access your storage account, the request must be made on HTTPS. "Secure transfer required" rejects requests that use HTTP. 

Secure transfer can be enabled by settings under configuration of the Storage account overview page.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a3.png)

#### 3.1.2 Advanced Threat Protection

Azure Storage Advanced Threat Protection detects anomalies in account activity and notifies you of any potential harmful attempts to access your account. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without the need of a security expert or manage security monitoring systems. 

On the storage account overview, click on advanced treat protection and click on **Enable Advanced Threat protection** to enable the feature.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a6.png)

#### 3.1.3 Shared Access Signature

A shared access signature token provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. With a SAS token, you can grant clients access to resources in your storage account, without sharing your account keys. This is the key point of using shared access signatures in your applications--a SAS token is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys.

 ![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a8.png)

#### 3.1.4 Encryption

One way that the Azure storage platform protects your data is via Storage Service Encryption (SSE), which encrypts your data when writing it to storage, and decrypts your data when retrieving it. The encryption and decryption are automatic, transparent, and uses 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available. 

On the Settings blade for the storage account, click Encryption. Select the Use your own key option. You should already create a key in the key vault.

You can specify your key either as a URI, or by selecting the key from a key vault.

*	Select the key from the key vault. 

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a11.png)
 
Select specific key vault which is deployed through Edison Arm template.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a12.png)
 
Click on **Select** under the Encryption key section.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a13.png)
 
Choose existing key or click on **+Create** a new key, assign key name and click on Create.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a14.png)
 
Proceed to click on **Save**.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a15.png)
 
If you want to check the key vault key go to the key vault resource and click on **keys**.

### 3.2 Cosmos DB Security

As a PaaS service, Cosmos DB is very easy to use. Because all user data stored in Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest and in transport, you don't have to take any action. Another way to put this is that encryption at rest is "on" by default.

d.	**sed -i -e 's/tls-secret-api/'<apisecret2>'/g' ProjectEdison/Edison.Web/Kubernetes/qa/Deployment/Ingress_Custom/nginx-config-api.yaml**
 
![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a97.png)
 
7.	Assign a static-IP to an Ingress on through the Nginx controller

a.	**On Admin:**

**az network public-ip create -g <Cluster Resource Group Name>-n <name of admin ip2> --dns-name <admin dns name2> --allocation-method static**

**Ex:**

az network public-ip create -g **MC_MO_basic_2304_akswih6_eastus2** -n **adminbotip2** --dns-name **dnsbotadmin2** --allocation-method static

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a98.png)
 
Copy the admin static IP and save it.

b.	**On API:**

**az network public-ip create -g <Cluster Resource Group Name>-n <name of api ip2> --dns-name <api dns name2> --allocation-method static**

**Ex:**

**az network public-ip create -g MC_MO_basic_2304_akswih6_eastus2 -n apibotip2 --dns-name dnsbotapi2 --allocation-method static**

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a99.png)
 
Copy the api static IP and save it.

8.	Install the NGINX Ingress controller into the system namespace using the existing static IP address and as AKS is not RBAC enabled, the command needs to set RBAC related values to false. 

**On Admin:**

**helm install --name nginx-ingress-admin stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system --set rbac.create=false --set rbac.createRole=false --set rbac.createClusterRole=false --set controller.ingressClass=nginx-admin --set controller.service.loadBalancerIP=”<admin Static IP2 address>”**
  
![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a100.png)

**On API:**

**helm install --name nginx-ingress-api stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system --set rbac.create=false --set rbac.createRole=false --set rbac.createClusterRole=false --set controller.ingressClass=nginx-api --set controller.service.loadBalancerIP="<apiStatic IP2 address>”**

Refer the **4 section** of the user guide to run the simulator.

**Note:** We need to add the **Admin** and **API** URL in the domain registry along with the external IP address for both, before accessing the Edison Admin Portal.   

To view the devices which got created or onboarded, Access the Edison Admin Portal and click on the wi-fi icon as shown below. Here you can also see the location, type, current response of the devices.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a126.png)

initially there are no events triggered. Once any event gets triggered from devices or simulator it will get reflected in the Edison admin portal as shown below.

## 6.0 Premium Solution Type

To perform HA when the primary region fails, we need to use secondary region (DR) components from the same resource group where all DR components were deployed as part of the Premium solution

### 6.1 Primary Region Configuration

 Refer the Section 6.4 in Deployment guide and refer section 2 in User Guide for configure the primary region. 
 
**Note:** We need to add the **Admin** and **API** URL in the domain registry along with the external IP address for both, before accessing the Edison Admin Portal.   

Access the Admin Portal with **Admin Url**. Initially there are no events triggered.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a128.png)
 
Follow the section 4 in user guide to send the simulator data.

Once the simulator data is sent the devices are created in admin portal.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a129.png)

Once any event gets triggered from devices or simulator it will get reflected in the Edison admin portal as shown below.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a130.png) 

By follow the section 4 in userguide you can acticvate the responces.Once activated will be shown in Responses like below.

### 6.2 Performing DR Strategies 

Perform the IoT Hub, Cosmos DB failovers as discussed in 5.3 and 5.4 section in above.

### 6.3 Dr Region Configuration

1.	Create a new direcotry "ProjectEdisonDr" for building the images in Dr region

2.	Copy the scripts-download.sh from /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/ to /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/ProjectEdisonDr/

3.	 Change directory to ProjectEdisonDr

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a132.png)

4.	To change the path for the downloading scripts, execute the below command.

**sed -i -e 's:'/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0':'/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/ProjectEdisonDr':g' scripts-download.sh**

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a133.png)

5.	Execute the scripts-download.sh file and clone the git hub repo in the current directory.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/ProjectEdison/raw/master/documents/Images/a134.png)
 
6.	Update the input.txt file inside the ProjectEdisonDr directory with Dr Region resource values.

**Note:** Keep the same **BASEURL_VALUE** and  **ADMINURL** for Dr Region.

7.	Refer the Section 6.4 in Deployment guide and refer section 2 in User Guide for configuring the Dr region configuration.

**Note:** We need to add the **Admin** and **API** URL in the domain registry along with the external IP address for both, before accessing the Edison Admin Portal.

As we are using same **Admin** and **API** Uris for **Primary and Dr Premium solutions,** Remove the Primary external IP address and update the Dr External IP address for Admin and API URL in the domain registry to access Dr region Edison Admin Portal.

Once we open Edison Portal Application, we will get the same "Activation Responses" and Devices which we created in Primary region.
